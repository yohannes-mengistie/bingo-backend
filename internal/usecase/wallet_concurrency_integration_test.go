// These cover the one thing the rest of the suite does not: what the money
// paths do under actual contention. ProcessWithdrawal takes a FOR UPDATE row
// lock before reading the balance, so concurrent withdrawals are supposed to
// serialize and each see the previous one's debit. Nothing pinned that, which
// meant a future refactor could drop the lock (or move the balance read before
// it) and silently reopen a drain-past-the-floor hole.
//
// The scenario modelled: a player who has just been credited a prize fires many
// withdrawals at once, hoping two of them both read the pre-debit balance and
// both pass MinBalanceAfterWithdrawal.

// withdrawalTestPhone is a valid Ethiopian mobile. seedUser's generated phone is
// not one (it is "0900"+telegram_id, far too long), so the payout destination
// must be supplied explicitly or Withdraw rejects before reaching the money path.
